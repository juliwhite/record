# Overview

The purpose of this software is to be able to create a list of students. We want to add student and display the students that we've just added in our program.

The program is built in the c++ language, and uses libraries like iostream, string, and vectors. It start from a main function and then depending on where options the user choose it will call this functions to work with data provided by the user. It uses control structurs, conditionals, while loops, for loops. switch, and also has a class. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}
